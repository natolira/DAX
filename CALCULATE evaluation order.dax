--version of 2023-03-11 (presented at SQLBits 2023) (first draft on 2022-01-10)
--The generic CALCULATE expression:

CALCULATE ( 
	[Measure], 
	F1,
	F2,
	KEEPFILTERS(F3),
	ALL(Tn),
	CROSSFILTER(...),
	USERELATIONSHIP(...)
)
------------------------
-- Can be rewritten as:
------------------------

VAR T0 = T        -- Avaliation: 0) Context transition from row context (if row context is active)
VAR T1 = F1       -- Avaliation: 0) Table from F1 is evaluated
VAR T2 = F2       -- Avaliation: 0) Table from F2 is evaluated
VAR T3 = F3       -- Avaliation: 0) Table from F3 is evaluated

-- After the evaluation of the table filters they are applied:

RETURN
CALCULATE(
	CALCULATE(
		CALCULATE(
			CALCULATE(
				CALCULATE ( 
					[Measure], 				-- Application: 6) Last step is the evaluation of the measure 
											-- (Expression can be changed if a calc item is among the filters)
					CROSSFILTER(...),		-- Application: 5) Model changes are reflected at POWER Matrix
					USERELATIONSHIP(...)	-- Application: 5) Model changes are reflected at POWER Matrix
				),
				KEEPFILTERS(T3)			-- Application: 4) Transparent filters (KEEPFILTERS) are applied
			),
			T1,                			-- Application: 3) Conventional filters are applied
			T2							-- Application: 3) Conventional filters are applied
		),
		ALL(Tn)							-- Application: 2) Filters are removed from the lineage (according to POWER Matrix)
	),
	T0									-- Application: 1) Context transition filter is applied
